# Example: web-links

This example is a simple web crawler that finds all anchor tags in a web page and 
follows the links to get to other pages. After a predefined number of pages are
fetched, it creates a graph of the pages using graphviz.

The crawler only fetches URLs that are of the form *github.com/user/repo*. Here is
a graph generated by this program starting from 
[https://github.com/topics/go](https://github.com/topics/go) limited to 200 URLs:
